# Bank Customer Segmentation and Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing over 1 million transactions by more than 800,000 customers for a bank in India. The focus is on customer segmentation, location-wise analysis, transaction-related insights, and customer recency, frequency, monetary analysis.

## Aim
The primary goals of this notebook are to:
- Perform clustering/segmentation of customers.
- Conduct location-wise analysis to identify regional trends in India.
- Analyze transaction-related patterns to improve user experiences.
- Perform recency, frequency, and monetary analysis on customer transactions.
- Optionally, conduct network or graph analysis of customer data.

## Customer Segmentation
Most banks have a large customer base with diverse characteristics. Customer segmentation is crucial for understanding and catering to the specific needs of different customer groups. The goal is to create meaningful clusters based on shared traits such as age, income, values, and lifestyle.

According to a report from Ernst & Young, a more granular understanding of consumers is a strategic and competitive imperative for banking providers. Customer segmentation provides insights that should be integrated into everyday business operations.
