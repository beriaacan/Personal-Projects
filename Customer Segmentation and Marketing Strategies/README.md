# Customer Segmentation and Marketing Strategies Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing customer behaviors in the retail sector, segmenting customers, and developing personalized marketing strategies. The analysis is based on data from a groceries firm's database, and Python along with various libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and Scikit-learn are used for implementation.

## Aim

1. Analyzing customer purchase behaviors and preferences using data analysis techniques.
2. Developing and implementing personalized marketing strategies for each customer segment.
3. Analyzing the impact on increased sales and customer satisfaction and presenting the findings to the management.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. Feature engineering to create new relevant features.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Label encoding categorical features, scaling features using the standard scaler, and creating a subset dataframe for dimensionality reduction.

- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:** Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to 3 components.

- **Clustering with Agglomerative Clustering:** Performing clustering using Agglomerative Clustering and examining the clusters formed.

- **Evaluating Models:** Exploring patterns in the clusters and drawing conclusions based on exploratory data analysis.

- **Profiling:** Profiling the clusters based on personal traits of the customers.
